                <p> <b>Hello! I'm Sazid Moontasir</b>

I’m a 17-year-old from Cumilla, where I was born and raised. My educational journey has been a rewarding one, starting with my PSC exam at Adra Government Primary School, followed by my JSC at Bholain Bazar High School, and then my SSC at Comilla Modern High School. Currently, I am pursuing my studies at Comilla Victoria Government College.

With a keen interest in technology and innovation, I have been actively involved in various projects, including developing chatbots and creating unique websites. My passion for learning and growth drives me to explore new opportunities and expand my skills.

Looking ahead, I have big dreams of establishing my own agency. I am excited about the prospect of working on diverse and impactful projects, contributing to the industry, and making a meaningful difference in the sector. My goal is to build a versatile and dynamic team that can tackle various challenges and bring creative solutions to the table.

Feel free to explore my site to learn more about my skills, projects, and aspirations. Thank you for visiting, and I hope to connect with you soon!
